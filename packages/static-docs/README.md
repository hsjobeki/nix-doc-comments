# Basics Example for an autogenerated Documentation Site

This is a basic example of autogenerated Documentation from nix-doc-comments.

> Note: The following step will be improved in the future

`nix build .#static-docs -L --impure`

> The pagefind integration somehow needs internet access didn't found the location I need to patch.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```sh
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ reference/      # AUTOGENERATED
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
