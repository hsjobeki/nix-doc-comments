# Overview

Welcome to the comprehensive _Nix API reference documentation_.

This resource serves as **your guide to understanding and utilizing the power of Nix** and covers a wide range of functions and libraries at your disposal.

Whether you are an experienced developer or just beginning your journey with Nix, this documentation will be a faithful companion.

Whether you are looking for a quick reference or want to delve deeper into Nix, this documentation is designed to meet all your needs. So let's go trough this journey together and realize the full potential of Nix.

Happy coding!

## What You'll Find Here

Our documentation spans across three primary categories:

### 1. Nix Builtins

Explore the core functionality of Nix with detailed insights into its built-in functions. These essential tools are the building blocks of Nix expression language.

### 2. Nixpkgs `lib` Functions

A dedicated extension and abstraction layer on top of the language builtins. Offering more advanced possibilities and convenient shortcuts.

### 3. Nixpkgs `pkgs` Functions

Some convinent functions used for packaging purposes, such as writing executable scripts, fetching tarballs or repositories and most importantly the `stdenv` environment, that almost everyone uses for declaring packages.

## Navigating the Documentation

To your left, you'll find a convenient sidebar listing all publicly available functions. You can easily navigate through the documentation by selecting the function or library you're interested in.

We also offer an integrated search feature on the top of the page.

## Documentation missing?

Feel free to customize and expand upon this introduction to suit your specific documentation needs.

See our [contributing guide](../further/contributing)

## Future Possibilities

It is possible to render all documentation for every nix-project in github as a subpage here. But still more work and research needs to be done.
