Recursively collect sets that verify a given predicate named `pred`
from the set `attrs`.  The recursion is stopped when the predicate is
verified.

# Example

collect isList { a = { b = ["b"]; }; c = [1]; }
=> [["b"] [1]]

collect (x: x ? outPath)
{ a = { outPath = "a/"; }; b = { outPath = "b/"; }; }
=> [{ outPath = "a/"; } { outPath = "b/"; }]

# Type

collect :: (AttrSet -> Bool) -> AttrSet -> [x]
