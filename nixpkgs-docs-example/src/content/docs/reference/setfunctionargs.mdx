Add metadata about expected function arguments to a function.
The metadata should match the format given by
builtins.functionArgs, i.e. a set from expected argument to a bool
representing whether that argument has a default or not.
setFunctionArgs : (a → b) → Map String Bool → (a → b)

This function is necessary because you can't dynamically create a
function of the \{ a, b ? foo, ... \}: format, but some facilities
like callPackage expect to be able to query expected arguments.
