Return an attribute from nested attribute sets.

# Example

```nix
x = { a = { b = 3; }; }
```

```nix
attrByPath ["a" "b"] 6 x
=> 3
```

> Note: This is equivalent to `x.a.b`

`6` is a default value to return if the path does not exist in attrset

```nix
attrByPath ["z" "z"] 6 x
=> 6+ 2
```

# Type

```haskell
attrByPath :: [String] -> Any -> AttrSet -> Any
```
