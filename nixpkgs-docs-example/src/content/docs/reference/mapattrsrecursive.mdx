Like `mapAttrs`, except that it recursively applies itself to
the *leaf* attributes of a potentially-nested attribute set:
the second argument of the function will never be an attrset.
Also, the first argument of the argument function is a *list*
of the attribute names that form the path to the leaf attribute.

For a function that gives you control over what counts as a leaf,
see `mapAttrsRecursiveCond`.

# Example

mapAttrsRecursive (path: value: concatStringsSep "-" (path ++ [value]))
{ n = { a = "A"; m = { b = "B"; c = "C"; }; }; d = "D"; }
=> { n = { a = "n-a-A"; m = { b = "n-m-b-B"; c = "n-m-c-C"; }; }; d = "d-D"; }

# Type

mapAttrsRecursive :: ([String] -> a -> b) -> AttrSet -> AttrSet
