import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Like builtins.foldl' but for attribute sets.
Iterates over every name-value pair in the given attribute set.
The result of the callback function is often called `acc` for accumulator. It is passed between callbacks from left to right and the final `acc` is the return value of `foldlAttrs`.

Attention:
There is a completely different function
`lib.foldAttrs`
which has nothing to do with this function, despite the similar name.

# Example

foldlAttrs
(acc: name: value: {
sum = acc.sum + value;
names = acc.names ++ [name];
})
{ sum = 0; names = []; }
{
foo = 1;
bar = 10;
}
->
{
sum = 11;
names = ["bar" "foo"];
}

foldlAttrs
(throw "function not needed")
123
{};
->
123

foldlAttrs
(_: _: v: v)
(throw "initial accumulator not needed")
{ z = 3; a = 2; };
->
3

The accumulator doesn't have to be an attrset.
It can be as simple as a number or string.

foldlAttrs
(acc: _: v: acc * 10 + v)
1
{ z = 1; a = 2; };
->
121

# Type

foldlAttrs :: ( a -> String -> b -> a ) -> a -> { ... :: b } -> a
