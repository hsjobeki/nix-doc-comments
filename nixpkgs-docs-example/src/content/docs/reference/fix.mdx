import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Compute the fixed point of the given function `f`, which is usually an
attribute set that expects its final, non-recursive representation as an
argument:

```
f = self: { foo = "foo"; bar = "bar"; foobar = self.foo + self.bar; }
```

Nix evaluates this recursion until all references to `self` have been
resolved. At that point, the final result is returned and `f x = x` holds:

```
nix-repl> fix f
{ bar = "bar"; foo = "foo"; foobar = "foobar"; }
```

# Type

```haskell
fix :: (a -> a) -> a

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator for further
details.
