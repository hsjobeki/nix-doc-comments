Like `mapAttrsRecursive`, but it takes an additional predicate
function that tells it whether to recurse into an attribute
set.  If it returns false, `mapAttrsRecursiveCond` does not
recurse, but does apply the map function.  If it returns true, it
does recurse, and does not apply the map function.

# Example

# To prevent recursing into derivations (which are attribute
# sets with the attribute "type" equal to "derivation"):
mapAttrsRecursiveCond
(as: !(as ? "type" && as.type == "derivation"))
(x: ... do something ...)
attrs

# Type

mapAttrsRecursiveCond :: (AttrSet -> Bool) -> ([String] -> a -> b) -> AttrSet -> AttrSet
