import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Does the same as the update operator '//' except that attributes are
merged until the given predicate is verified.  The predicate should
accept 3 arguments which are the path to reach the attribute, a part of
the first attribute set and a part of the second attribute set.  When
the predicate is satisfied, the value of the first attribute set is
replaced by the value of the second attribute set.

# Example

recursiveUpdateUntil (path: l: r: path == ["foo"]) {
# first attribute set
foo.bar = 1;
foo.baz = 2;
bar = 3;
} {
#second attribute set
foo.bar = 1;
foo.quz = 2;
baz = 4;
}

=> {
foo.bar = 1; # 'foo.*' from the second set
foo.quz = 2; #
bar = 3;     # 'bar' from the first set
baz = 4;     # 'baz' from the second set
}

# Type

recursiveUpdateUntil :: ( [ String ] -> AttrSet -> AttrSet -> Bool ) -> AttrSet -> AttrSet -> AttrSet
