Return a string containing a JSON representation of *e*. Strings,
integers, floats, booleans, nulls and lists are mapped to their JSON
equivalents. Sets (except derivations) are represented as objects.
Derivations are translated to a JSON string containing the
derivationâ€™s output path. Paths are copied to the store and
represented as a JSON string of the resulting store path.
